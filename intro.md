# Introduction

Greetings, and congratulations on being the newest member on the team!
We are creating the groundbreaking game *World of Codecraft*. 
Did we mention you’re the sole member with any experience? 
You might have to carry us a bit.

What makes the game special? 
Well, we like to keep things nostalgic, so it’s a text-based and turn-based RPG. 
Also, our strategy is to get rich with minimum investment, though our marketing department said that we shouldn’t let buyers know.
*Nostalgic Turn-Based RPG* apparently sells better than *Hopefully a Cash Cow*.

We currently don’t have anything to show yet, and we hope you might help us out here, with your experience and all.

Buckle up, your coding journey begins!
Pixels may be sparse, but imagination goes a long way! (I should talk to marketing about this, we should make that our slogan or something)

Ready? [Let’s go](1.md)!
