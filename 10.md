# 10 - Adding Some Class

Whew, crisis averted.
Our users are happy with the rebalance you did!

However, they keep saying the game lacks depth... geez, they're so needy.
We've been playing around with the idea of introducing a class system,
consisting of 3 classes: Warrior, Mage and Ranger.
Could you help us out?

- Each character has a class
- Warriors deal 10% more damage to rangers
- Rangers deal 10% more damage to mages
- Mages deal 10% more damage to warriors

Done already?
That's all we had for now...
Well, actually you could take a peek [here](beyond.md) for some extra work.
