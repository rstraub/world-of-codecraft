So, the players have spoken.
They really liked the idea of equipment, and we're seeing a big influx of new players.
But, as always, there were suggestions to improve.

This time there were complaints about the equipment being too weak, and it doesn't scale well.
Let's address these issues:
- Equipment now doesn't add a fixed value, but a percentage of the character's stats
- Common equipment increases the character's stats by 10%
- Rare equipment increases the character's stats by 25%
- Epic equipment increases the character's stats by 50%

Done already? 
That's all we had for now... 
Well, actually you could take a peek [here](beyond.md) for some extra work.
