# 4 - Leveling Up

Great! Our users can now do something useful in the game. Weâ€™ve been getting feedback that they get bored with the game pretty quickly. Maybe we should add some character progression?

- Each kill nets 500 XP
- Cap the level at 10
- Characters level up at 1000XP
- After that, each level requires 50% more XP

Done already? [There's more to do](5.md)!
