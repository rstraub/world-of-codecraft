# 3 - Are You Not Entertained?!

Good, players now have characters with health.
However, it turns out there isn’t much to do for them yet.

Time to add the core element of the game: combat.

- Characters can fight each other
- An attack deals 200 fixed damage
- An attack can only damage other characters

Done already? [There's more to do](4.md)!
