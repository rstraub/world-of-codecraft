# 8 - Equipment

As you might know, players are always looking for ways to improve their characters.
We don't yet offer many ways to do so, but we had this idea to introduce equipment.
We're curious to see how the players will react to this!

- Characters can equip a weapon and armor
- Each weapon has a damage value
- The damage value is added to the attack damage
- Each armor has a defense value
- The defense value is added to the defense value

Let's start with three tiers of equipment: common, rare and epic.
If the idea is well received, we can add more tiers later.
- Common equipment has a damage/defense value of 10
- Rare equipment has a damage/defense value of 50
- Epic equipment has a damage/defense value of 100
