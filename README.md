# World of Codecraft Kata

A fun kata to practice software design and modeling.

Ready to start? Head off to [the introduction](intro.md).

## Retrospective 

After the kata, or any step in between, take some time to reflect. Here are some questions to consider:
- What went well?
- What didnâ€™t go well?
- Which lessons did you learn?
- Would you do something different if you were to start over?

## Explanation

Most code katas are a simple small problem, involving little software design. 
They also do not simulate the realistic scenario of incrementally building up a system with changing requirements. 
These scenarios are why we design our software - to enable change. I
specifically wanted this kata to stretch slightly beyond that.

This kata can be used to practice:
- Software Design
- Modeling
- Dealing with changing requirements 
- Tidying/refactoring
- Creating feedback loops

To maximize learning, I recommend the following:
- Do not peek ahead to the following "iterations". This will hamper the effect of having to change design.
- Collaborate with others.
