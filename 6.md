# 6 - A Real Hit!

Do you remember that XP thing we added? Players were complaining it’s unfair to only get XP if they kill something. Apparently players were stealing kills from each other.

- Each successful hit nets 50 XP

Also, there appear to be a lot of people with too much time on their hands. Many players have already reached the level cap and are bored.

- Raise the level cap to 80

That’ll keep them occupied for a while

Done already? [There's more to do](7.md)!
