# 2 - A Matter of Life & Death

Great! We really like what you’ve done so far. 
The first players were able to create characters with enjoyable names (including swearwords, but who has the budget to fix that…)

Didn’t we tell you we released the game after the first feature you built? 
Ah… well we did. 
No pressure, but people paid for the game and are eagerly awaiting something to actually do.

We should add the crucial element of life and death to the game. 
Without it, we can’t build anything worthwhile!

- Characters start with 1000HP
- A character dies when its health reaches 0HP

Done already? [There's more to do](3.md)!
