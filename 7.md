## 7 - Something with Numbers 

Things are looking great! World of Codecraft is getting attention and the userbase is growing.

Letâ€™s see if another feature might pull in even more players! We had this idea about letting characters have stats, groundbreaking right?

- Each lvl increases HP by 100
- We also added attack and defense as stats
- Attack starts at 200
- Defense at 100
- Each level increases attack and defense by 25 points 
- Attack determines damage dealt
- Defenses reduces damage taken

Done already? 
That's all we had for now... 
Well, actually you could take a peek [here](beyond.md) for some extra work.
