# 5 - Experienced Fighters

Players have been really positive about our most recent addition, and are happily grinding away, leveling up their characters. But there have also been complaints saying the level of the character is just vanity and doesn’t change anything.

I hate it when users are correct…

Let’s give them something and see if it sticks.

- Level difference between characters in combat changes damage dealt
- An attacker deals 25% more damage per level he is higher than the defender
- An attacker deals 25% less damage per level he is lower than the defender

Done already? [There's more to do](6.md)!
